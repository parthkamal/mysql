mysql commands; 

show databases; ---> list the databases; 
create database [db_name]; --> to create a database; 
drop database [db_name]; ---> to delete a database ; 
use [db_name]; -- > to switch to a database ; 
select currentuser(); --->shows the current user; 
select database(); ---> shows the current database in which you are in; 
create table [table_name] (col1, col2, col3, col4....);


for example, let's create a user table ; 

create table user (id int(11) primary_key, name varchar(100) not null, city varchar(50));


show tables; ---> will show the tables present inside the database.
desc [table_name]; --> will give details about the table
drop table [table_name]; --> will delete the complete table
alter table [old table name] rename to [new table name]; --> for renaming a table
truncate table [table_name]; ---> used to truncate the table; 
insert into [table_name](id,name,city) values(12,'durgesh','delhi'); ---> for insert a new values (specifying a order); 

insert into [table_name] values(12,'ankit','kanpur'); --> for inserting new table row (without specfying the order);
alter table [table_name] add col1; --> used to add a new column
update [table_name] set col1='value' where col2='value2'; ---> update the column values;
delete from [table_name] where (condition);
select * from [table_name]; ---> show all rows from table
select * from [table_name] where (condition); -------> select all rows where some conditions are met;

select col1,col2,col3 from [table_name];--> specify the columns from the table to be shown;
we can also use and or clauses in defining the condition of the sql query; 
select * from student where id between 23 and 234 ; 
select * from student limit 4 ; __> gives the top 4 results; 
select * from student limit 3 offset 2; ---> phle 2 chhodke aage ke 3 results; 
select * from student order by id desc limit 2; --> gives the bottom 2 results; 
select * from student where name like 'a%'; --> all the rows where name starts with a;
select * from student where name like '%t'; ---> all the rows where name ends with '%t';
select sum(id) total_id_sum from student;




foreign keys and joins ---> 


create foreign keys --> 

create table laptops (lid int primary key, lmodel varchar(20), studentId int, foreign key (studentId) references student(id); --> creating a foreign key column in table laptops refering from student id ; 
select student.name, student, laptops.model from student innder join laptops on student.id = laptops.studentId;






//mysql basic command


Difference between mysql sever and mysql client - 

Mysql server - it is a server program. It is used to manage the connection with database located locally or disk (local). 

Mysql client - it is like a command line shell , which communicates like a client to mysql server.


Database - database is a software which stores data in an organized manner. So it becomes easy to manage data

Mysql - popular database software which is used to handle data in an relational manner. ( it is like a example of database ) other examples like mongodb

Relational manner - in the form of tables, rows, and columns.

Relation between tables can be established by using foreign keys. 

///  How mysql works? 

Whenever we install mysql from official website , it automatically installs the database server (mysql server) and the client (mysql client) (command line shell). Mysql works like a client server architectures , in which client can be a shell or a gui(workwench, phpmyadmin) through which we can execute the query . which is handled by the database server. 


On installing mysql what i found. 

Configuration directory for mysql was /etc/mysql/
Inside this -> my.cnf is the main configuration file ( which includes the location of client and mysql server configuration file. 

/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysql.cnf  -> configuration file for mysql client (command line shell)

/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf -> configuration file for mysql server (database server)

/var/log/mysql/error.log -> log file for any error

/var/lib/mysql -> mysql data directory


//uninstalling mysql complete from linux

To start the sql server - > systemctl start mysql 
Root login - > sudo mysql and then enter password


From root login you will enter the sql shell
